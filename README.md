# Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using the Iris dataset. The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on features such as petal length and width.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features:

- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

Each sample is classified into one of three species:

- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

## Code Overview

The provided code performs the following steps:

1. **Load the Iris Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using `scikit-learn`.
2. **Convert to DataFrame**: The dataset is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
3. **Map Species Labels**: The target labels are converted from numerical values to species names.
4. **Prepare Data**: Features and target labels are separated, and the data is split into training and testing sets.
5. **Train Model**: A Logistic Regression model is trained on the training data.
6. **Evaluate Model**: The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated on the test data, and a classification report is generated.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the Project Folder**

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. **Run the Script**

   - **For Windows:**

     ```bash
     py main.py
     ```

   - **For Linux/Unix:**

     ```bash
     python3 main.py
     ```

The script will output the accuracy of the model and a detailed classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score for each species.

## Results

The script will print the accuracy of the model and a classification report.

## Further Improvements

- **Experiment with Other Models**: Try other classifiers like `KNeighborsClassifier`, `DecisionTreeClassifier`, or `SVM`.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust model parameters to potentially improve performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features or transformations to enhance the model.
